# fluttergpt
A flutter application designed for desktop use of ChatGPT by ChatGPT.

This application was designed using GPT-4. Some manual code changes were made though 80% of the code was machine written. The application does **NOT** securely store the API key, it saves it in a .json settings file in the users documents folder.

I have no intention of managing this project, I just wanted a ChatGPT like interface to use my API Keys with. There are still some outstanding changes to be made such as adding support for rendering markdown and syntax hilighting.
