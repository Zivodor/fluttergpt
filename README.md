# fluttergpt
A flutter application designed for desktop use of ChatGPT by ChatGPT.

This application was designed using GPT-4. Some manual code changes were made though 80% of the code was machine written. The application does **NOT** securely store the API key, it saves it in a .json settings file in the users documents folder.

I have no intention of managing this project, I just wanted a ChatGPT like interface to use my API Keys with. There are still some outstanding changes to be made such as limiting the number of messages in the conversation to send and adding a setting to control it, as well as adding support for rendering markdown and syntax hilighting. I would also like to add some metrics information to conversations.

## Features
- Light/Dark Mode
